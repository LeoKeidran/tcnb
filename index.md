## Introduction
This guide is aimed to provide insight and guidance on the techniques and strategies employed while speedrunning TCNB. This is aimed towards those who have played the game, however would like further details on how to improve.
Each chapter has its own page, as well as each Stigma strain to help you keep each area digestable.

## Overall Guidance

Given TCNB relies on precise motor skills to control the Wiimote and the Nunchuck, much of getting better at the game will revolve around lots of practice and getting more comfortable with the controls. New Blood has the highest cursor sensitivity, potentially as it was made in 4:3 but stretched to 16:9, though this isn't confirmed. What this can mean is if you are coming from other Trauma Center titles the cursor may feel very, very fast. With practice this won't be an issue, but you may find your hand is fatigued playing New Blood more than other titles. You can attempt to alleviate this by setting your monitor to force 4:3.
Just like learning an instrument, starting off slow and ensuring you get the motions down is just as important as your knowledge. If you start slow, you can build up your speed the more you practice.

### Sensor Bar
Given that everything is controlled with the cursor, it's crucial to ensure your sensor bar is setup to give you consistent results. You'll need to change these settings on the Wii settings menu outside of the game. Firstly, make sure your sensor bar is set to the correct location, either above or below the screen. This will off-set the cursor to make it feel more natural. This isn't strictly necessarly, but helps with preventing pointing the Wiimote at an uncomfortable angle.
For the Sensor Bar sensitivity, you should aim to have this as low as possible. If you have the perfect conditions, having this set to 1 will be best, but depending on your setup, you may have to use 2 or 3. The lower the better if possible. I definitely recommend checking this setting, as you may find your sutures and stars become much more reliable.

### Tool Switching
Luckily in NB we use the nunchuck to tool switch, so we don't have to waste too much time with tapping the tools we want unlike in the DS games. But being able to select the tools you need at the exact time will help with your pacing. You'll be less likely to fumble, or to miss and waste precious vitals. Brachion will push your tool switching to a new level. Anticipating when you need to tool switch, and then executing means you are spending less time waiting around, even if it is for only a second it will add up over the course of a full run. That being said, don't take this too far. You don't want to be tool switching too early. This is especially true with sutures as they will be discarded if you tool switch away before letting go of A or B.
If your nunchuck suffers from "snapback", where you hold the stick and let go and it selects the opposite tool, the best way around this is to simply lock the stick into the direction you are using at the time. The exception to this is if you're always going to be using that tool (eg: Cheir requires the laser 90% of the time, so there is no use holding the stick down all the time). This means the stick cannot snap back into the opposite direction and select the wrong tool.

### Healing Touch
The Healing Touch (HT) in New Blood is vastly improved compared to the versions in Second Opinion. As such, most operations will rely on you using Markus' and Val's HT in many, many instances. To compare, Markus' HT will slow down time by a third, and is used to get ahead of any cycles that aren't scripted (such blood pools spawning, but not some defibs). Val's HT is used whenever there is huge damage that comes in, that using the syringe would take far too much time to get vitals at a stable level. There are a few cases where using Val's HT is faster compared to Markus' such as the burns as the time you spend boosting is wasted compared to getting ahead of a blood cycle. <br>
Providing a full list of each use case for HT would be incredibly extensive, so I would highly recommend putting an indicator in your splits for when you might need to select Val in the run. Each episode title in this guide will also have an indicator.

### Menuing, Text Skip, and Episode Select Skip
Outside of the operations, it's easy to lose time just by selecting the wrong option. And while this is often more of a newcomer's mistake, ensuring you select the right option (and at the right time too) will help you shave time off. Whenever you start an operation, you only need to button mash A without pointing the cursor to hit YES. But at other opportunities, it's important to be ready to use your cursor to snap to each option. I don't recommend using the D-Pad as you can point your cursor much faster without readjusting your grip. Additionally you should be mashing A when the map appears, as well as when you finish an operation to get through the "Patient is Saved" message and score screens.
Without text skip, New Blood would be insalely long (looking at you Trauma Team). It's as simple as pressing the minus button ( - ) on your Wiimote to turn on text skip and let the dialogue fly by, but knowing when to do this can be tricky. There are three set times you should remember:
* When you first load an operation, after mashing through the map and title card, when the dialogue gradient (or character appears), start the skip.
* When you load into the chart or post operation, same deal. As the dialogue gradient appears, start the skip. You can use minus to also dismiss the initial chart message (unlike in SO).
* As the operation loads in, before the "Operation Begins" prompt finishes, ensure you start Text Skip.

An Episode Select Skip, or commonly known as an ESS, is performed after every operation with one exception. Each episode has post-operation dialogue after you get the score. The only operation you shouldn't perform an ESS on is 5-6, which you should mark with an asterisk ( * ) on your splits. To perform an ESS, after the transition from the score card, hit plus ( + ) to pause, then select Episode Select, and YES.

### Gel and Bandages

The gel in New Blood was completely overhauled since the previous games, meaning that it is much more reliable. As such, you should be gelling the incision every time, given that if you don't you are very, very likely to miss. For membranes, small cuts, minor hemorrhages and holes, you can slather the gel across these without worry that it may not be effective.
For the bandage, as long as it covers approximately 40% of the incision you should be okay (this can vary wildly as I have observed some bandages that should have missed but counted, and vice versa). That being said, if you miss, it will cause 3 vitals to be dropped and you can kill the patient with this, so be sure to be more careful if the patient is very low. You **don't** want to gel before the bandage (except in 1-1) as it is much slower.

### Posture, Stretching, and Breaks

Since you're pointing a Wiimote for over an hour, it's important to ensure you are comfortable and that your hand is stable and well supported so that you are relaxed. Each runner has their own preferred posture and way to sit during runs, however they all share one key concept. You want to support your wrist (and forearm) as best you can. This ensures your hand is naturally stable, and that the cursor isn't shaking when you are just aiming to hold it still at a given point on the screen. For me personally, I use a blanket between my lower thighs/knees as this adds some padding/cushioning, as well as a foot-rest. I ahve seen other runners sit with their arms in a sort of inward V facing the screen with their forearms resting over their thighs, and other runners place it at the very top of their thighs near their hip. Find whatever is comfortable for you!
Following on from this, it's **very** important to stretch, to give your hand time to relax. Mid-run there are opportunities to stretch your hands out and ensure they do not cramp up. Nearly every operation with a few exceptions have 30 seconds of dialogue, and some upwards of 60 seconds. I highly recommend [this video](https://youtu.be/EiRC80FJbHU) from Dr Levi. It covers a lot of important stretches, and how to loosen up your hands too.
When you're on the grind to get a new time it's easy to forget to take breaks. If you don't, you are near guaranteed to give yourself Repeatitive Strain Injury (RSI). Just give yourself a few minutes to allow your muscles to relax, and your joints to ease up, plus you're less likely to get tilted too! This is especially important during practice. Operations such as 2,5 6-5, and 6-6 are notable strenuous. Don't allow yourself to play the same operation over and over and over for more than 20 minutes without stopping for two minutes at least.


### Vitals
Given that the game revolves around healing patient and keeping them alive, it may come as a surprise that in the speedrun environment we avoid vital boosting. Simply put, it takes up precious time that we could be using to deal with the patient's condition. It varies per operation of course and if I was to list out a set of numbers, it would be stupidly long and be near useless to go over it all as you wouldn't remember it. But learning when to not boost the vitals will mean you're not wasting time. With time, you can get a feel for this.
On the contrary however, if you are sitting around waiting, for example your tool has burnt out, or you are waiting for an animation or cycle, boosting the vtials up while you wait is a good use of your time. Don't let this go too far when you are boosting vitals into the time you could be spending to finish the operation. Prime examples of this include:
* Waiting for the next phase of Brachion
* Waiting for Soma to reappear
* Waiting for the drain to come back on 4-3

### Region Differences

Running the game in Japanese saves around 20-30 seconds across the entire run compared to English. However, if you own an NTSC-U copy of New Blood, you can also run the game in Japanese if you have access to a HomeBrew Launcher that can alter the console language. With this all said, running in JP isn't necessary, and isn't critical to start running this game (or any of the other Trauma Center games). Let me stress: **this is not critical. Just because you have a PAL/NTSC-U (without HomeBrew) copy does not mean you shouldn't try.**

For refernce, it is still possible to close into a time of around 1:35:00 comfortably without worrying about localisation. It is just common that after improving your time and investing yourself into the game for long enough, that having a JP or NTSC-J copy of the game is likely, and not a requirement.
