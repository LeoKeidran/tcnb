## 1-1

At the very start of the op, you'll need to inject nearly a full syringe of stabiliser. <br>
An easy way to remember where the vial will be is at the bottom of the right laceration where the dialogue fade is. <br>
For the most optimal layout you should suture the right cut, then the triple on the left, alternating directions for each suture to reduce wasted movement. <br>

Once you've opened up the forearm, the order in which you extract the bone fragments is the order you'll need to set them down in. For this reason, you should extract the bones in the same order every time - you should eventually reach a point where you no longer have to look at the piece to know where it will go. As an example of the order to take them: <br>
![](/img/1-1_boneOrder.png) <br>
The rotations on these bone pieces can be pretty awkward and oddly precise, and letting go of A or B can jostle your hand too. The most comfortable way is to premptively rotate your hand in the opposite direction the bone will need to go, pick up the pice, then bring your hand back to rest, and drop the fragment. <br>
Don't forget to gel the incision before the bandage.

## 1-2

When lasering the small tumours inside of the patient, you should laser from the bottom left upward and to the last on the right. <br>
Then, you can gel back in the opposite direction, this way you move the cursor back and forth less. <br>
![](/img/1-2_miniTumours.png) <br>
The first proper tumour is always location bewetween the two small tumours here. You must ultrasound it: <br>
![](/img/1-2_firstTumour.png) <br>
Cutting the tumour can be done in any straight line across the location, it doesn't necessarily have to be vertically. In this instance, doing a small vertical slash is the fastest way to expose it. <br>
After you patch up the membrane with gel, the camera will pan down for another three tumours that will need extracting. You can excise them by doing a single cut with the scalpel diagonally, from around the score number to the tool-wheel: <br>
![](/img/1-2_tripleTumours.png) <br>
Optimally you want to deal with each tumour one by one, draining them, cutting them and extracting. Don't place the membranes until all three are out. <br>
The mini-tumours that spawn don't cause blood pools in this op, so it's best to place the membranes, then laser them and gel. This can be tricky to do, so you may want to laser the tumours before placing the membranes if you aren't quite there yet. <br>
With the membranes placed, and mini-tumours lasered, slather the gel to clean up. <br>
Don't forget you shouldn't put any gel down before the bandage.

## 1-3

Because membranes take time to fade out, you'll want to drain the blood, put a membrane down and gel, then suture the cuts last. <br>
Once inside the patient, again it's best to focus on the bullet extraction. Drain the middle blood pools: <br>
![](/img/1-3_bulletBlood.png) <br>
Extracting the bullet segments themselves is pretty straight forward. Don't forget you have to drain after any step you do. You should be able to pull the bullet out without going at an angle to clear the wound to drop it onto the tray: <br>
![](/img/1-3_bulletAngle.png) <br>
After the flatline, extract the rest of the bullet, and place the membrane and gel, then drain the rest of the blood on the heart. Don't forget there is a defib, this hits the moment the final blood is drained!

## 1-4

After you've opened the patient, and dealt with the two blood haemorrhages, you should laser, cut, and extract all four electric chips. <br>
When placing the new chips in, leave the furthest left point open, as this is closest to the draining point: <br>
![](/img/1-4_lastChip.png) <br>
Upon placing the third chip, blood pools will begin to spawn. You should drain the three here:
![](/img/1-4_bloodPools.png) <br>
Once HT has activated, you'll want to aim to place the last chip into the slot. A bloodpool can spawn in the way of this, so to mitigate this issue, you can instead drain the blood pools that are remaining, then place the final chip, followed by gelling across the organ to remove the haemorrhages.

## 1-5

In the pre-op dialogue, there is a bit of text before the card, don't forget to hit skip after you have entered the episode. <br>
To start, you should extract both tumours, one by one: <br>
![](/img/1-5_firstTumours.png) <br>
A full syringe can't deal with all three inflammations here, so upon taking out one of the large ones, top-off with a quick tap on the vial <br>
Doing it this way means you must then instantly select the ultrasound, hit A to confirm the prompt, and pan down. <br>
Again, deal with the two tumours first, followed by the inflammations. There are a little overlap on the hitboxes: <br>
![](/img/1-5_secondTumours.png) <br>
Be mindful when panning right, as you don't want to overlap the vial over the inflammations and block them off. An ideal placement looks something like this: <br>
![](/img/1-5_inflammations.png) <br>
Once these have been dealt with, pan up, and extract the tumour that is located below. Make sure to deal with this before you deal with the last set of inflammations. <br>
![](/img/1-5_finalTumour.png)

## 1-6

Drain the two bloodpools in the overlap, gel the cuts and the incision but **do not** open the patient yet. You want to boost them up to 56, more if you are not completely comfortable with the fast strats. <br> 
Once inside the patient, drain the three blood pools, suture the lacerations, and locate the four hidden bleeders. You can just use the scalpel without ultrasounding here: <br>
![](/img/1-6_firstCuts.png) <br>
You should drain them and suture them in the same order, unless you know you are fast enough. These cuts are pretty awkward and difficult to suture, so take it easy, and aim to suture 4 or 5 lines over them. <br>
After you have sutured these, you can immediately search for the next four. If you are lower than 26 vitals, you will likely kill the patient: <br>
![](img/1-6_secondCuts.png) <br>
It doesn't matter how high the vitals are here, they'll lock to 1 (or 0 if you are that risky). You'll want to drain all the blood except the top right pool, and suture up all the cuts. <br>
From there, you need to cut the two hidden bleeders located here: <br>
![](img/1-6_finalCuts.png) <br>
If at the right pace, the last bleeders will burst, you can drain the blood and suture everything up.
