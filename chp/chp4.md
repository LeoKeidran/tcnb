## 4-1

The first half of this op is pretty straight forward. The injection takes about three quarters of a syringe. <br>
Note that with the appendix tie offs, the optimal way to use them is to pull them towards the bottom left of the screen, to the tool wheel. <br
![](img/4-1_tiesAngle.png) <br>
For the second patient, once you are inside pop Markus' HT immediately. <br>
Next, drain all the pus, and inject the serum into the appendix. Once you cut out the appendix, you may find that pus will spawn. You will need to drain this before you put the ties on, and remove the appendix fully. <br>
Once you cut the appendix for the second time, more pus will spawn, you should drain all of this before you apply the membrane and inject all the inflammations. <br>
Lots of these inflammations are overlapping, and you'll want to take full draws of the syringe (unless you are on the last one or two that don't need a lot) to reduce how many times you are going back and forth across the playspace. <br>

## 4-2 [V]

When you load this episode, there is a lot of dialogue before the episode card, so be ready to hit skip after the map instead of mashing A. <br>

Unlike some of the other blood pools, you'll need to drain all three pools on the outside of the patient individually, they **don't** have overlapping hitboxes. <br>
Once inside, aim to deal with the large lacerations, then the normal sized ones, and then finally the glass and haemorrhage. <br>
When you activate HT will depend on how fast you were, and if you got any misses. But popping Val's Healing Touch before you pan down here is safe enough that even if it was to run out you'd be fine. <br>
With HT active, pan down and deal with the lacerations, glass and haemorrhages as before, and then deal with this hidden cut here: <br>

When you pan up to the middle of the organ, you'll need to deal with the haemorrhage first, and deal with these two hidden cuts as well: <br>
![](img/4-2_secondHiddenCuts.png) <br>
Finally pan up to the top of the organ, you should expose the two hidden cuts found near the top of the large laceration. Doing this first is to ensure that the damage doesn't apply given HT is still active. <br>
You can drain, use the forceps to close the large laceration, and then suture this and the hidden cuts all collectively.

From there, clean up the rest. You may find one of the haemorrhages will turn to a blood pool if you are on the slower side. <br>

## 4-3 [V]

The first three tumours will spawn mini-tumours upon extraction. These can cause blood pools, so it's highly recommended you laser these, and drain any blood before you place the membranes: <br>
![](img/4-3_firstTumours.png) <br>
After you gel the membranes, there is a small delay before you can move the view, so do a small boost. This can be a little tricky to achieve at first, but the extra vitals you can give you a larger buffer. <br>
Pan the view up so that the very top blood pool sits at the vital bar, and then expose the three tumours here: <br>
![](img/4-3_secondTumours.png) <br>
When dealing with these tumours it's important to **not** place membranes done. Your goal here is to get to the drain failure as soon as possible. <br>
The fastest way to do this is to then expose the two tumours that spawn in between this triangle of the existing tumours: <br>
![](img/4-3_thirdTumours.ong) <br>
The moment you try to drain one of these tumours, the timer will begin. From there it will take just over 20 seconds before the drain is back. This gives you time to fully deplete the syringe to boost the vitals up, and expose the remaining tumours. You may need to pan the camera to do this, but you will want to pan it back up when you are done: <br>
![](img/4-3_fourthTumours.png) <br>
An easy way to count down how long you have left until the drain is back is to fully deplete the syringe, and then when it has returned, continue to boost until it reaches orange durability, nearly red. This isn't a 100% consistent way to determine how long you have left, but will help with getting an idea of how long this period is. <br>
If you are feeling riskier, you can laser some of the mini-tumours that span, but be warned that the vitals will quickly drop if there are too many of these. <br>
To ensure you select the drain the moment is is free again, you should lock your nunchuck stick into the right-down diagonal to select it the moment it is given back to you. <br>
Once the drain is back, you want to drain all the blood in the upper area of the organ where the three tumours are/were. Next, drain the two tumours, and remove them. Your goal is to place at least two membranes before the heart massage cancels your inputs. This can be incredible tricky, and if you aren't quite up to speed, you'll want to ensure the vitals are high enough that the patient doesn't die while they undero fibrillation. <br>
It is possible to apply gel onto these membranes while the patient is fibrillating but you risk dropping the vitals excessively. Depending on how much mess there is, the vitals can drop by 15 vitals or more in this time alone. <br>
Prepare for the heart massage, and just like in 2-2, you want to aim for six total cools. Two goods equate to a cool, in the event you miss one. <br>
After the heart massage, immediately pop Val's Healing Touch, and begin to clean up the rest of the organ, working from top down. You should laser any mini-tumours as these are very easy to miss given their size and colour on the organ. Even if HT finishes towards the end you should have enough vitals for the patient to not be in danger. <br>
