## 3-1

Trying to time when you should use Markus' Healing Touch here can be a little tricky, but the rule of thumb is to take off three seconds from the IGT timer, after you have opened the patient. If you are consistent at opening the patient, you should activate HT at 4:56:00. <br>
![](img/3-1_bufferHT.png) <br>
You should buffer the star so you only need to let go of A or B to pop it. <br>
With HT active, you now want to ultrasound the gallstone which will be located here: <br>
![](img/3-1_gallstone.png) <br>
Once the gallstone has been lasered, you can inject nearly a full dose into the gallblader. Keep in mind at each step of excision you will need to drain. <br>
After you've done the four stages of excision, drained and removed the organ, you should slather gel to remove the haemorrhages, and do a medium to large sized suture zig-zagging left to right. <br>

## 3-2

Right at the start, you want to drain the blood. You can drain two blood pools at once if you aim in the space between them: <br>
![](img/3-2_bloodPools.png) <br>
From there, suture the lacerations, grab the glass and gel across everything. This should mean the incision line is gelled, but if it isn't you can slap a fresh line across it. <br>
Inside the patient you want to aim to work from one side to the other. Doing this can be tricky though, so alternatively you can deal with the large lacerations, small lacerations, and finally the glass. <br>
Once this first area is dealt with, pan down the view to the bottom of the organ. Again, deal with the large laceration, then the others, before the glass. There will be a haemorrhage that spawns near the lower glass shard. <br>
Afterwards, pan up to the middle of the organ, and gel over the for haemorrhages that spawn there. <br>
Finally, pan to the top of the organ. Depending on your speed, you may find that the haemorrhages will form into blood pools. To aid you with this, it can be better to grab the glass out, and gel over the entire area to stop this from happening. However, with practice you should be able to deal with the lacerations first, with the glass and haemorrhages last. <br>

## 3-3

There are multiple ways of dealing with this op. After opening the patient you will want to deal with the first occlusion. Note that the moment you place the membrane, the second occlusion will spawn and its timer will start for where the alignment begins. <br>
For the following two occlusions and membranes you need to place on them, note that the way the alignment must fit around the membrane is much tighter than it might appear. Especially so with Markus' Healing Touch active.
![](img/3-3_alignment.png) <br>

*With HT*: The moment you have placed the first membrane down, you will need to activate Markus' HT right away, then deal with the membranes as usual. Doing it this way is considered much safer, and **highly recommended novice and intermediate runners**. <br>

*Without HT*: There are two ways to do this op without Healing Touch. Both of them are very risky and as such this strat is aimed **only to high tier runners**. <br>
1. The easier version is to deal with the membranes as usual, and instead of rotating your wrist to the position of the current angle, rotate to the next angle instead to increase your odds of getting the timing right. <br>

2. The riskier method is to place the membrane down on the earliest cycle. Doing this is incredible hard, and requires you to rotate your wrist very quickly. The reward for this is a few seconds of timesave. The benefit to this however is that in the event that you back-out, you can simply wait and readjust for the next cycle. <br>

You may get an extra haemorrhage or two, deal with these after the occlusions.

## 3-4

***Please follow the Soma Advice found under [Stigma - Soma](../stigma/soma.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>

With this first appearance of Soma, you will have three cycles of just the core without a dupe. Additionally, before the dupe, Soma will always spawn where the core was damaged, meaning you do not need to search for where it may be. <br>

## 3-5 [V]

Picking Markus here isn't necessarily a bad option, but having Val's HT as a safety net is generally recommended for newer runners. <br>

It's possible to drain the two blood pools on the right by aiming between them: <br>
![](img/3-5_bloodPool.png) <br>
After you drain all the blood at the start of the op, don't immediately select the syringe, else you won't have the serum available. Select it after the aneurysm spawns. <br>
Injecting this first aneurysm only needs about a third of a syringe: <br>
![](img/3-5_firstAneurysm.png) <br>
After taking out the first one, pan up the view and take a full syringe of serum, to tackle the next two that spawn: <br>
![](img/3-5_secondSet.png) <br>
With the first pair dealt with, the next pair will spawn very quickly. You should be able to deal with the one near the vitals without panning. <br>
You will need to pan left, and down to get the one that is further down. Again, these don't much much more than half to deal with each one. <br>
![](img/3-5_thirdSet.png) <br>
After you deal with the last two on the left, you will have 4 seconds to pan the view up and to the right. It's recommended you boost the vitals in the time you wait. <br>
You should also pull a full syringe of serum, and if you are opting to use HT, do so right before the aneurysms spawn (approx 3.5s after you get the suture on the last set). <br>
![](img/3-5_HT.png) <br>
Deal with these two aneurysms as normal, pan the camera down and deal with the aneurysm that is towards the right. The sooner you remove this, the earlier the final two that will need injecting will spawn. <br>
You should not aim to inject the aneurysm on the far left, as this should burst around the time you finish treating the third aneurysm in this wave. <br>

As general advice for aneurysms, you should aim to inject two aneurysms at once with a full syringe, but once they have been cut you should process them one by one. This means you spend less time moving the cursor, and you are less likely to get extra blood if you are slower. <br>
