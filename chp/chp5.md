# 5-1

The inicison line is lower than you might think for this op, so when you gel the small cuts in the elbow and upper arm, slather gel down to the fore-arm as well, that way you can cover the incison as well. <br>
You should deal with the blood, then the lacerations, followed by the small cuts. Then the incision. <br>

The moment you are inside of the patient, you should pop Markus' Healing Touch. This is to stop the convulsions. It is possible to complete the op without, but it is far too risky, especially this far into the run. <br>
It can be a little deceiving, but after you've removed the hockey stick fragment from the bicep, it's just a large suture across the wound to patch it up. <br>

The ligaments can be a little tricky if you have an unstable hand. If you want to be safe, you can suture after each little group, but to be optimal you should aim to pull across all three sets before you suture. <br>

## 5-2

The moment you enter the patient, you'll need to do a defib, so pull back on your Wiimote in the loading time. <br>
You should first drain all the blood across the organ: <br>
![](img/5-2_bloodDrain.gif) <br>
From there, you should suture all the cuts, and place all the membranes down. <br>
Placing these membranes can be a little awkward, and similar to burns you need to be mindful that placing a membrane in the approximate area where another should snap to the nearest one, but if it is too far away it will cause a miss. <br>
![](img/5-2_membranes.gif) <br>
Fibrillation will likely start on the membranes. If you are getting a defib during this process, you will want to aim to be a little faster to get ahead of this. If the heart has flatlined, you can still gel (at the cost of a miss) and bypass this if done correctly. <br>

## 5-3

Much like in the previous op, the information regarding the membranes will be the exact same. <br>
Unlike in 5-2, when you load into the patient you won't have a defib to start you off, and instead you'll want to expose all the hidden cuts. You should do this *before* you start draining. <br>
![](img/5-3_hiddenCuts.gif) <br>
You should deal with these on "sides", so clean up the left three cuts. Before you move to the right side, ensure you drain each blood pool on the packing area at least once. This will aid you in the second patch up. <br>
![](img/5-3_drainBlood.gif) <br>
On the right, again, cut out each hidden cut, drain everything and suture it all up. Be mindful to angle your sutures here given the precision needed for this hidden cuts. <br>
![](img/5-2_membranes.gif) <br>
If a bloodpool spawns in the middle of the packing process, be ready to drain it, and replace any membranes that might fall. If you are very unlucky you may end up having to defib the patient. If done optimally and following the drain method mentioned above this shouldn't happen. <br>

Keep in mind after the op, you'll need to mash through the map before you can ESS.

## 5-4 [Hard]

First thing to note about this operation is you should play it on ***Hard.*** <br>
This is due to the reduced timings for Onyx's apperances.

***Please follow the Onyx Advice found under [Stigma - Onyx](../stigma/onyx.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>

The fastest way to find Onyx at the start of the op is to mash the ultrasound (with A) around the organ. <br>
The music will change the moment you find Onyx, which makes it considerably quicker compared to other ops. <br>

## 5-5 [Hard]

You should continue to stay on ***Hard*** as changing difficulties takes time compared. Staying on Hard should give no drawbacks on this op. <br>

Not all of these blood pools will contain bullets. Additionally, wounds that need a pellet extraction will bleed faster. As such, you should aim to clean up each area in pairs on the outside of the patient, like so: <br>
![](img/5-6_outsideBlood.png) <br>
With the outside dealt with, inside of the patient you should clean up each pellet and wound individually: <br>
![](img/5-6_pelletsInside.gif) <br>
Note that the two blood pools on the left have to be cut to expose them for extraction. Every stage will require draining. <br>

## 5-6* [Hard] 

You should continue to play on ***Hard*** for the same benefits listed in 5-4. <br>

***Please follow the Onyx Advice found under [Stigma - Onyx](../stigma/onyx.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>

Much like in 5-4, you should mash the ultrasound to find Onyx quickly, especially as there is no music cue to let you know you have found it. <br>

This is the only op where hitting text-skip after the operation is faster than to perform an ESS. <br>

## 5-7 [Hard]

There is quite a bit of dialogue before the puzzle, and so I highly recommend stretching. <br>
We perform this operation on ***Hard*** as it is less moves than doing so on Normal. <br>

There is no set order in which you need to complete the puzzle, so pick and choose a order that suits you best, however faster runners have opted to start at the top left, and work their way clockwise around the puzzle. This is in part due to the amount of rotations you can do before you need to reset your wrist. <br>

Each turn takes around 45 degrees to properly connect, rather than the suggested 90 degrees that the game makes it look like. <br>
