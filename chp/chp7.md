## 7-1 [V]

If you have done Z-2 in Second Opinion before, this operation is very similar. <br>
Unlike in SO, the vein hitboxes are a little bigger, meaning you don't need to be quite so precise to ensure you cut them. <br>
Note that when you have multiple tumours, you must extract them together in a short period of time, rather than one by one like you would with normal tumours. <br>
You may get blood pools with the mini-tumours, so just keep this in mind. <br>
On the second wave, there is a big pause before you can do anything, however you can hold the drain above where a tumour will spawn: <br>
![](img/7-1_secondWave.png) <br>
You shouldn't need to worry about the vitals, as we use Val's HT. <br>
For the third wave, you should fully drain one of the tumours (pick one). This will cause the black out. <br>
After the blackout, activate Val's Healing Touch, then use the lighter to see where you are working on. <br>
It's recommended to place the light in-between the two tumours on the right like so: <br>
![](img/7-1_finalTumours.png) <br>
Keep in mind you shouldn't extract the tumours until all three are free to do so, else you risk them regenerating. <br>
Val's HT will likely finish up around the time you extract the tumours out. From there, you should laser up the mini-tumours. There are four on average per tumour itself, and you may get blood pools. <br>
Be mindful to look carefully with the lighter, as these mini-tumours are small and can be easy to overlook as you move the light around. <br>

## 7-2

This operation is ***three*** Stigma patients back to back. <br>
***Please follow the Brachion, Soma, Cheir and Onyx Advice found under [Stigma - Brachion](../stigma/brachion.md), [Soma](../stigma/soma.md), [Cheir](../stigma/cheir.md), and [Onyx](../stigma/onyx.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>

While there are three patients, the second and third have multiple strains of stigma. <br>

Patient 1 has Brachion. <br>
Patient 2 has Soma and Cheir. <br>
Patient 3 has Soma and Onyx. <br>

If you are reasonably comfortable with each strain, then this op will be relatively straight forward. The main issue comes from overlapping timers and letting things get out of hand. <br>

Brachion in this op is nearly no different from the previous encounter in 6-3. All the same techniques apply, just be wary as you will encounter more short-arm branches. <br>

For the second patient, you will want to activate Markus' Healing Touch the moment you are inside the patient. <br>
Focus Cheir until you have completely cleared it. Note that the waves are as follows: two cheir, two cheir, and one extra once one dies in the previous wave. <br>
Soma may occasionally drop red tumours. Be sure to laser these to ensure that they do not worsen and cause additional vital drops. It can be a little tricky trying to tackle these, but if you time to laser them between HP hits on Cheir this should be possible. <br>
With Cheir out the picture, focus on Soma like you would normally. <br>

Inside the their patient, you should ignore Soma until Onyx has been defeated. <br>
Onyx will **always** be located under Soma right at the start: <br>
![](img/7-2_onyxLocation.png) <br>
Keep in mind that Soma will occasionally drop red tumours, which need to be looked after during the operation. It's critical to do this else the vitals will drop further. <br>
Between hits on Onyx, you should do a few boosts, given that the webbing phase does damage, and Soma will also do damage on core exposure. <br>
Onyx should be relatively straight forward, and from there tackle Soma like you would normally afterwards. <br>

## 7-3

This op is relatively straight forward, but does require additional care. It is easy to make a small mistake, and if repeated kill the patient. <br>
At the very start of the operation, pop Markus' Healing Touch, this is to prevent the pins in the next phase from event activating. <br>
Extract the chips from the centre on the first part, this should be a straight forward extraction as the sparks should keep out the way with HT active. <br>
![](img/7-3_chipExtract.gif) <br>
On the next phase, be careful when removing these pins. They are varying lengths but the important part is to take them out completely straight: <br
![](img/7-3_pins.png) <br>
With the pins out, on the final phase, you need to be mindful of the moving sparks. Taking this segment slower than you might want to is advised until you are 100% comfortable. <br>
This can be done relatively safely by following this path. Just note that it does close off, but other routes are available. Be flexible and do not commit to a path that is too narrow. <br>

## 7-4

There is a lot of downtime here, so stretch for the final few operations! <br>
For the best time save, playing as Markus here will be faster, as you don't have to select Val before the operation starts. That being said, if you are not comfortable with the gel-boosting strats, picking Val is perfectly fine, as this was the previous method. <br>

With the patient open, you want to slather gel until they reach approximately 60 vitals. This should perfectly time you for the first injection. <br>
Note that for each wave, you *must* inject the white serum first, before you can inject any others. This can be injected anywhere, it does not to be in the masses. <br>
Yellow injections take just over half the syringe. This means if you have more than one yellow, you will briefly need to top up the syringe, just for a moment. <br>
![](img/7-4_yellowInject.gif) <br>
Blue injections take nearly a full syringe, just over three quarters, meaning after each injection you should top it up to full. <br>
![](img/7-4_blueInject.gif) <br>
Red injections take exactly half the syringe, meaning that you can treat two per full syringe. <br>
![](img/7-4_redInject.gif) <br>
It's best to memorise each wave to know what is coming. This may feel daunting, but it helps grealy with your pacing. <br>
After the second wave, you should boost the vitals up with the gel again to just over 60, just to give some stability. <br>
Generally, you should deal with Red first, Blue next, and Yellow last. Below is the wave order to help you: <br>

Wave Order: <br>
1. x1 Yellow
2. x2 Yellow (small gel boost)
3. x1 Red / x2 Yellow
4. x2 Blue / x1 Yellow (small gel boost)
5. x2 Red / x3 Blue
6. x3 Red / x1 Blue / x1 Yellow
7. x2 Red / x2 Blue / x1 Yellow <br>

Note that by the fifth wave, the syringe will go to the yellow stage of durability (meaning <50% is left). This is common, and means you will need to be mindful with each injection to cause it to be "burnt-out" or unavailable. If you are unsure, do not inject if the syringe is in the red. <br>
If you are opting to use Val's Healing Touch, you should pop her HT after wave 4. <br>

## 7-5

In this op, you are at the mercy of the heart fibrillation. As such, you may have a delta of 10 seconds depending on the result. <br>
Open the patient up, and wait for the two cutscenes of revealing the heart, and then opening the pericardium. The moment you are given control, activate Markus' Healing Touch. <br>
Laser all four chips, cut them and extract them. <br>
Cutting the heart control unit can be very tricky, given its shape. Take this slow at first, and with time you can get faster: <br>
![](img/7-5_unitCut.gif) <br>
With the unit cut, extract it and laser the bomb-core. Then cut around it repeatedly until it is out. <br>
![](img/7-5_bombCut.gif) <br>
The heart may begin to fibrillate here. Keep going. Even if you are cut off, you can hit A on the node to cut it, at the cost of a miss. As long as you don't drop the vitals below 20, you should be fine. <br>
If you do not get a heart massage, congrats! You got lucky. Place the unit back in. Note that it is *very* precise on the angle the unit is at, and not necessarily where it is in the space in the heart. <br>
![](img/7-5_unitPlacement.png) <br>
With the unit in, place the chips in. You may have some haemorrhages to gel up. <br>

## 7-6

The very start of this op has a tiny bit of dialogue after the map, and before the title card. Just keep this in mind. <br>

***Please follow the Cardia Advice found under [Stigma - Cardia](../stigma/cardia.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>

The chart for this op is significantly longer than nearly every other chart. Take this time to get one last little stretch in. You need it. <br>

I'll avoid repeating the guidance provided in the Cardia guide, given this op is the only op to have it. <br>
The op is split into two. The start is *very* similar to burns, requiring you to gel membranes and extract them. At first, you may want to opt to just extract segments rather the entirity of it. <br>

The second phase is much more tricky, given the overlapping timers. Don't feel rushed to aim to do the fast kill. Popping Markus' Healing Touch after the second HP hit is considered safer and overall the better method for newer runners. <br>
