## 6-1

Do not forget to switch back to ***Normal*** in the event you did the last four operations of Chapter 5 on Hard. <br>

***Please follow the Brachion Advice found under [Stigma - Brachion](../stigma/brachion.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>

Given this is the introductory operation for Brachion, generally you have a little more time compared to other operations with Brachion in. <br>
That being said, all the same advice applies. I would highly recommend using this op as practice to improve your Brachion strats. <br>

## 6-2

Getting a feel for the timings of these flashing tumours can be rather painful. <br>
You can do this operation with, and without Markus' Healing Touch, though if you are not 100% comfortable with your ability to tool switch fast enough, I would recommend using HT.

*With HT*: From the moment you load inside of the patient, you'll want to drain the top left tumour. You then want to cut it out, and extract it. But do not apply a membrane. Pop Markus' HT and then deal with the right most tumours. Then deal with the far left tumour. The bottom middle tumour should begin to flash, meaning you can also extract this. While waiting for the last tumour to flash to blue, place the membranes onto empty holes, and then finish up the last tumour and gel it all up. <br>

*Without HT*: This strat is much tighter, but applies the theory that you do not want to place membranes until the end. Start with the top right tumour, then the bottom right. From there, deal with the bottom left, bottom middle, top middle, and finally top right tumour. If you fumble the first tumour, it will re-flash back to blue by the time you extract the last tumour. <br>

## 6-3 [V]

This operation is ***three*** Stigma patients back to back. <br>
***Please follow the Soma, Brachion, and Ops Advice found under [Stigma - Soma](../stigma/soma.md), [Brachion](../stigma/brachion.md), and [Ops](../stigma/ops.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>

The first patient is Soma. <br>
Unlike the first appearance of Soma, you do not get a phase that doesn't have additional masses you need to drain at the start. Additionally, red tumours will drop earlier into the op, so keep this in mind. <br>

The second patient is Brachion, and will be very similar to [6-1](chp6.md#6-1). <br>
Don't rush through this patient. As long as vitals are high enough it you shouldn't have to worry about killing the patient, but it can be a big sink hole of time if you fumble a lot. If you are struggling, use 6-1 as practice. <br>

The third patient is Ops. <br>
Unlike the first appearance, you will need to open the patient up. Otherwise, it is essentially the same as [4-5](chp4.md#4-5-v). <br>

## 6-4 [V]

This op has an element of RNG, where in you may get an extra defib in the middle of the op. There isn't really any way to alleviate this problem, meaning you'll need to be acutely aware of when this happnes. <br>
Loading into the op, there is a defib right away, so pull your Wiimote back. Note that this defib is slower, and much earlier compared to the normal defib. <br>
After the defib, deal with the cluster of three blood pools and pellets: <br>
![](img/6-4_rightPellets.gif) <br>
Note that all of these pellets can be extracted after one blood pool drain. You should deal with these as a cluster, rather than individually due to the overlapping hitboxes. <br>
From there, you now will want to deal with the pellets on the left. To play it safe, you should deal with just two pellets. The faster you get, the more pellets you can clean up at once. <br>

*With Extra Defib*: You can tell if you will get an extra defib on this op when the heart begins to convulse, after a moment you will get an extra dialogue box (with Elena on it). This means you must wait until the defib appears. Pull back on the Wiimote in this time. <br>
The moment you finish the defib, pop Val's Healing Touch, and clean up the other pellets (if applicable). <br>

*Without Extra Defib*: When the heart convulses, it will suddenly stop and Val will appear with a text box. You can then immediately pop Val's Healing Touch, and continue the cleanup. <br>


Regardless of what happens, you should be careful of the two bottom pellets. They have hidden cuts that are easy to cut instead: <br>
![](img/6-4_hiddenCutsNearPellets.png) <br>
When dealing with these pellets, you may get some haemorrhages, do not treat these for now. <br>
With the pellets dealt with, you can now clean up the four hidden cuts: <br>
![](img/6-4_hiddenCuts.png) <br>
You will likely have a defib begin here, during this clean up. If possible, finish the clean up and gel over any haemorrhages. This will replace the random based defib, with a scripted one to finish the operation. <br>

## 6-5 [V]

This op is very intensive on your wrists. Be sure to stretch in the pre-op dialogue. <br>

This first patient has burns. Be mindful as this op starts immediately into a defib, so pull your Wiimote back. <br>
Unlike 2-5, these burns are very prone to worsening. As such, there is a particular order in which you should be treating them: <br>
![](img/6-5_burnsOrder.png) <br>
This is critical to ensure you do not end up with an extra 3rd degree burn which requires coolant. <br>
When trying to place membranes on the bottom right most burn, be careful to not go too quickly, as you are likely to place the membrane on the wrong burn otherwise due to overlapping hitboxes. You should also drain *all* of the blood, for the same reason. <br>
Apart from this changed placement method, you should follow the same techniques advised in [2-5](chp2.md#2-5-v). <br>

The second patient starts with lots of blood pools and bullet holes that need patching. <br>
Note that the two bullet holes on the left side still have the pellets. Depending on your speed, you can either remove these two, and patch them up, and then drain the rest and patch up, *or* you can remove those two pellets, then drain all the blood and put down the membranes collectively. This can be a bit risky if you aren't up to speed. <br>
![](img/6-5_pulletsOutside.png) <br>
The incision line will appear a little late, as the membranes must disapppear fully. <br>
Inside the patient, you should work left to right, tackling each affected area until they are fully dealt with before you move onto the next thing. This removes excessive cursor movements. <br>
The bullet on the left here is much like in [1-3](chp1.md#1-3), however there is no heart failure during the process. <br>
Keep in mind that each step of any bullet extraction will require a drain. <br>
The only pellet in this area of the organ that needs cutting is the top right one. <br>
![](img/6-5_insidePellets.png) <br>
Once you are done, pan the camera down, and again you will have two pellets to deal with, the left pellet will need cutting to remove it. <br>
![](img/6-5_insidePelletAgain.png) <br>

The third patient starts off with blood, lacerations and cuts on the exterior. You can drain the blood in pairs as they have overlapping hitboxes. <br>
![](img/6-5_bloodOverlap.png) <br>
From there, suture up the cuts, extract the glass and gel across the chest as a whole. Before you open the patient you should also provide a full injection of stabiliser. <br>
Once inside, much like previous ops, deal with the large cuts, then lacerations, and finally glass. <br>
When you pan down, make sure to go far enough that you can see the glass on the left without it being obstructed by the tool wheel, as it can be easy to miss otherwise. Again, same order of operations ideally. <br>
From here there are five hidden cuts: <br>
![](img/6-5_hiddenCuts.png) <br>
These hidden cuts do 6 vital damage each, so you'll need a minimum of 30 vitals at this stage if you want to cut all of them. You should tackle these in pairs ideally. <br>

The fourth patient is a variation of [2-3](chp2.md#2-3-v), so much of the same will apply. <br>
On the outside of the patient, you can drain some of the blood collectively as it overlaps. You should also suture before you gel to reduce extra steps. <br>
Inside of the patient, suture the two lacerations, and then pull out all the bone fragments. Be careful doing this, as with each fragment you pull there will be blood spawning, and it can be hard to see which direction to pull them out. Remember that the order in which you extract them will be the same order you set them down. <br>
![](img/6-5_boneAngles.png) <br>
With all the bones out, gel over all the holes, drain up the blood and clean up as usual. <br>
Finally set the bone fragments down, and gel over. There won't be a defib during this patient. <br>

The final patient requires some careful execution. Given we used Val's HT on the first patient for the burns, you won't have quite the same safety net. <br>
Before you enter the patient, you should boost the vitals to near maximum, 63-65 vitals should be fine with a little bit of leeway.
Once inside the patient, drain the blood, and gel up the haemorrhages, then cut these four hidden cuts: <br>
![](img/6-5_finalPatientHiddenCuts.png) <br>
As you being cleaning these up, more cuts will appear. Focus on cleaning up the four you have exposed. <br>
Next there will be another four you need to expose. It's best to do this, rather than letting one of them burst due to the vital loss. <br>
![](img/6-5_finalPatientSecondHiddenCuts.png) <br>
Finally deal with the last few haemorrhages with gel. If at any point you feel the vitals are too low, you should have time to boost. <br>

## 6-6

Trying to use the speedrun tech here can feel incredible difficult, as there are three timers essentially that overlap. But, with some practice and understanding you'll get there. <br>

***Please follow the Cheir, and Onyx Advice found under [Stigma - Cheir](../stigma/cheir.md), and [Onyx](../stigma/onyx.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>

There are no entry incisions to these patients, meaning when you start, you'll be launched right into the patient to begin the transplant. <br>
There is a lot of information to go over, so I will mostly focus on the general approach given it relies on your Stigma knowledge for both Cheir and Onyx. <br>

The first patient is the simpler side, and only has Cheir. This should be relatively straight forward. <br>
Cheir will spawn the moment you connect the vein (blue vessel) to the liver. Be sure to suture this cut or you will tank vitals. <br>
![](img/6-6_veinConnection.png) <br>
You may find it easier to take on Cheir by panning the view over a little, but this isn't completely necessary. <br>
Before you even consider taking on the transplant segements of the op, you should focus on Cheir. There is a window where you can get the yellow/portal vein after you have processed two waves of Cheir. <br>
![](img/6-6_portalVeinConnection.gif) <br>
This is very tricky, and until you are very confident with your tool switching, don't worry about not completing this. <br>
Deal with Cheir fully, and then worry about the transplant: <br>
1. Yellow/Portal Vein (requires just over one full injection)
3. Red/Artery (requires two full injections)
4. Green/Bile Duct (requires two full injections) <br>

The second patient will require the same order as above. However, this patient also has Onyx. This can make pacing out the steps for stopping Cheir from killing the patient difficult as you are constantly on a timer. <br>
Top runners aim to get two injections into Onyx before they pop HT. I highly recommend watching a top runner's run to see this operation and how this is performed. <br>
Like in the previous patient, the moment you connect the vein to the liver, Cheir *and* Onyx will spawn. Just one Cheir will spawn this time. <br>
![](img/6-5_earlyOnyxAndCheir.gif) <br>
From the moment you suture the vein up, you should aim to look for Onyx and get one injection in. <br>
Next, laser Cheir until Onyx has finished diving, and search for Onyx once more. Note that it can only be in the transplanted organ space. <br>
Repeat this until Cheir dies and you have two Cheir to take on. This is when you should pop Markus' Healing Touch. <br>
![](img/6-5_markusHtPop.gif) <br>
In the time that you are waiting for Cheir to die, you can focus on Onyx and it's position. <br>
Depending on the timing of your injections and juggling Cheir, you will likely find that you have two or three hits left on Onyx as the HT wears off and you reach mature Cheir. <br>
Ideally Onyx should die before Cheir, due to the timing nature of its attacks. With Onyx dead you can focus on pushing Cheir off the organ, and keep it there until it dies. <br>
Finalise the transplant in the same way as the previous patient, just note that the artery (red vessel) connection is located at the top of the organ space. <br>
