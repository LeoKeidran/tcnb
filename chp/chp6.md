## 6-1

Do not forget to switch back to ***Normal*** in the event you did the last three ops of Chapter 5 on Hard. <br>

***Please follow the Brachion Advice found under [Stigma - Onyx](../stigma/onyx.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>

Given this is the introductory operation for Brachion, generally you have a little more time compared to other operations with Brachion in. <br>
That being said, all the same advice applies. I would highly recommend using this op as practice to improve your Brachion strats. <br>

## 6-2

Getting a feel for the timings of these flashing tumours can be rather painful. <br>
You can do this operation with, and without Markus' Healing Touch, though if you are not 100% comfortable with your ability to tool switch fast enough, I would recommend using HT.

*With HT*: From the moment you load inside of the patient, you'll want to drain the top left tumours. You then want to cut it out, and extract it. But do not apply a membrane. Pop Markus' HT and then deal with the left most tumours.Then deal with the far left tumour. The bottom middle tumour should begin to flash, meaning you can also extract this. While waiting for the last tumour to flash to blue, place the membranes onto empty holes, and then finish up the last tumour and gel it all up. <br>

*Without HT*: This strat is much tighter, but applies the theory that you do not want to place membranes until the end. Start with the top left tumour, then the bottom right. From there, deal with the bottom left, middle left, top middle, and finally top right tumour. If you fumble the first tumour, it will re-flash back to blue by the time you extract the last tumour. <br>

## 6-3

This operation is ***three*** Stigma patients back to back. <br>
***Please follow the Soma, Brachion, and Ops Advice found under [Stigma - Soma](../stigma/soma.md), [Brachion](../stigma/brachion.md), and [Ops](../stigma/ops.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>
