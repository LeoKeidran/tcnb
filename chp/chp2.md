## 2-1

Just like in previous ops, you'll want to extract the tumours one-by-one to reduce how much time you waste moving the cursor around. You can drain the pus while moving your cursor over: <br>
![](img/2-1_firstTumours.png) <br>
After you extract any tumour, you'll need to drain the pus before you can place the membrane down. <br>
With both tumours extracted, you can then deal with the inflammation. After this is cleared, immediately pop Markus' Healing Touch. <br>
Pan the camera down so that the top right pus is nearly off screen but still visible. This allows you to excise all three tumours in one screen. Again, treat each tumour one-by-one, draining the extra pus along the way: <br>
![](img/2-1_tripleTumours.png) <br>
Finally, pan the camera all the way to the top of the organ. The last tumour, depending on the final position you pan up to is around the centre of the HT bar. For an organ reference, see below: <br>

## 2-2

After you open the patient, you'll need to wait a moment, and will need to do a heart massage. Unlike the defib, you can't hold one of the buttons pre-emptively, and as such will need to press buttons simultaneously to massage the heart. It takes 6 cool massages to complete the resuscitation (aka three OKs). An OK is registered as two cools, and two goods equate to a cool. <br>
![](img/2-2_massage.gif) <br>
During the massage you should place the cursor at one of the cable entry points, and be ready to gel the moment the massage is complete. <br>
Pulling out these cables can be tricky, so aim to pull them directly away from the point they go into the heart in a straight line. <br>
It's best to deal with each cable individually, and after suturing them up, you can then extract the cables, and the pacemaker itself <br>
You can then instantly place the new pacemaker, but be very careful with the cables. Their hitboxes are awkward, and need special care to place them. <br>
If at the right pace, you can circumvent the extra defib by inserting both cables, as this will cause a scripted massage to take place. To achieve this, you don't need to suture up the cables, as this can be done after the massage. <br>

## 2-3 [V]

You won't need to do an incision, and will be taken right into the patient, and started with a defib. <br>
After the defib, you should deal with the large laceration first, and suture up the small cut next to it. <br>
This next stage can be tricky if you aren't quite up to speed, and you may need to do an emergency boost with the syringe. You should aim to pull out all five bone fragments. The order in which you take them out is the same order they will be presented to you on the tray, so aim to do this the same order every time. <br>
![](img/2-3_boneOrder.png) <br>
With the bones extracted, slather gel over across the entire organ to deal with the small cuts, and haemorrhages. Then drain all the blood pools and suture up the cuts. This is where you may need a vital boost if you aren't confident. It can help to drain the upper area, suture, and then deal with the lower area of the organ. <br>
Place the bones down into their respective places, and on the fifth piece, pull your Wiimote back for a defib. Be mindful a miss here will drop the vitals by 5. <br>
As the cutscene plays out, you want to wait for the moment just after the blood appears and the bone fragment emerges. Then draw a star and buffer it, don't activate HT immediately, wait about a second so that you activate Val's Healing Touch just before you gain access to your tools. <br>
![](img/2-3_bufferHT.png) <br>
With Vital Lock in place, you can drain all the blood pools, suture up the cuts, extract the bone fragment and then set it once everything is sutured. <br>

## 2-4

The moment you finish suturing up the cuts on the heart, the first Cheir will spawn.

***Please follow the Cheir Advice found under [Stigma - Cheir](../stigma/cheir.md) for this operation. The below is operation specific advice.*** <br>

Given this is the tutorial to cheir, there is a bit of a delay after killing the first individual Cheir, you can spend this time boosting in the event that Cheir makes some lacerations. <br>
Following standard Cheir removal, you should alternate after a confirmed drop in Cheir's HP. <br>
Given you cannot pan the camera view, the best side to aim to move Mature Cheir is to the right, where there is a little more space off the organ. But that being said, just keeping it off the organ is enough. <br>

## 2-5 [V]

This op is likely the first op where you may experience wrist discomfort. Please take the time to stretch before this op begins to reduce the strain. <br>
Loading in, you want to be locked into selecting the syringe, and aiming your cursor on the left side of the 2nd degree burns towards the bottom as an estimate for where the vial will be: <br>
![](img/2-5_vialPlacement.png) <br>
You should take a full dose of the culture, and inject it into four spots, as well as a fifth though this will not be enough. You should do this twice, then take about third of a syringe to inject the final three squares. <br>
![](img/2-5_skinGrafts.gif) <br>
This is a tricky process, and takes lots of practice to achieve, but this is the most optimal way to get a full set of grafts. <br>
With all 12 grafts ready to be cut out, you should pop Val's Healing Touch and cut these out with vertical cuts, as it overall less movement: <br>
![](img/2-5_cuttingGrafts.png) <br>
With these cut out, drain the three blood pools on the top set of 2nd degree burns, and place the grafts down. Be mindful that if you place a graft on a burn that already has four grafts, it will count as a miss. You may also notice the graft doesn't land exactly where you place it, this is because the burns have overlapping hitboxes. With all the membranes on, gel over these to finalise treating those burns. <br>
![](img/2-5_placingGrafts.gif) <br>
In the event you drop a graft, you should continue placing the rest, and gel what is there. Then inject a single square, cut it out to replace what you lost. <br>
Repeat the process with making grafts while still under the effects of HT. If you cannot cut them out before it ends, don't worry, this is normal even for high tier runners. The vitals will end high enough that this should be fine. <br>
When draining the blood covering the bottom three 2nd degree burns, ensure you drain 6 blood pools here. If you don't, you're likely to have a blood pool spawn and cause the grafts to drop off. <br>
Finally repeat the process one more time with the grafts, but before cutting them, also pull around two thirds of the coolant and inject them into the 3rd degree burns, then cut the grafts, and the upper two burns out. <br>
![](img/2-5_finalBurns.png) <br>
When you remove the first 3rd degree burn, blood will spawn. This shouldn't get in the way of placing the membranes, but I recommend draining them before you place any down to be safe. <br>
You will need to then pan the camera down, and cut out the final burn. If you are very confident it is possible to do so without moving the view, but it is tricky and not really worth the minor timesave. <br>

Keep in mind that this op is pretty strenuous and is likely the first op where you'll feel it in your wrist. You can stretch during the next operation as well. If you are practicing this op multiple times, be sure to take breaks.
