# Stigma - Onyx [Claw]

[Back to Main Page](../index.md)

***This advice applies to all Operations that involve Ops.*** <br>

On it's own, Onyx poses very little threat, and effective removal relies purely on keeping track of it as it moves. And given it moves only in a straight line, generally speaking it is one of the easiest Stigma strains inthe game. <br>

## Movement

As mentioned, Onyx moves in a purely straight line. This means that when it dives, whether it has clones or not, it will will be in a single line that can very quickly be scanned. <br>
Combined with the fact that Onyx **cannot** exist outside of the organ boundaries, and finding Onyx becomes very trivial. <br>

## Initial Spawn

For the first instance of Onyx in [5-4](../chp/chp5.md#5-4-hard) you can easily tell where it is located as the music will change once you have found it with the ultrasound. <br>
In other instances, you will need to locate Onyx in the organ, as it does not have a dedicated spawning location. There is one exception to this: [7-2](../chp/chp7.md#7-2) where it will always spawn under Soma. <br>

## Searching

While you don't **need** to ultrasound Onyx to be able to cut it out, slashing blindly across the organ isn't very productive. So except for when in 7-3 mentioned above, you should use the ultrasound/panning tool to search. <br>
You shouldn't necessarily spam the ultrasound, nor do you need to actually locate it before cutting it out. <br>

A strategy I highly recommend is to spam the ultrasound *only* when looking for a single Onyx body. This only occurs on the first time you go to search for Onyx, and subsequent searches will have clones. <br>

Once Onyx has clones, focus on just the four dotted variant, ignore all other copies. This will travel in a straight line, between where it dove and the organ boundary. Note that it can resurface at the same location it dove. <br>

## Difficulty

Due to experimentation and discoveries by Ossan, a Japanese runner who came in by storm and set new World Records, it was found that Onyx has much shorter cycles on Hard. This means that for the two operations in [Chapter 5](../chp/chp5.md) that feature Onyx, it makes more sense to do these on Hard. <br>
No additional practise or special awareness is needed, just make sure to focus on the four dotted variant and you'll get through these ops without any issue.
