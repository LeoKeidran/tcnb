# Stigma - Ops [Eye]

[Back to Main Page](../index.md)

***This advice applies to all Operations that involve Ops.*** <br>

While not necessarily threatening, Ops can often be a tripping point for newer runners due to the optimised technique we employ to make any operation involving it as quick as possible. <br>

## Before Healing Touch

Your primary goal is to get to the Healing Touch stage as fast as possible. <br>
To do this, you must laser Ops' core as much as possible, without letting the vitals drop too low. It is okay to burn out the laser here as it restores much faster than if you were to attempt to extend the durability. <br>
However, if you notice a nutrient is about to hit the core, or more importantly a *red* nutrient, it is best to either drain or laser it before it can make contact. <br>

As bursting tumours spawn in you must keep this in check. The biggest risk factor when it comes to employing this strategy is the tumours. <br>
Each tumour does 20 damage if burst, which happens when the core is hit by a nutrient of either variety. <br>
Given the vitals are around the 50 mark, two tumours can spell disaster given that when the nutrient hits it also deals damage. <br>
To be on the safe side, I highly recommend killing off these tumours as you go, or to ensure there is only one on screen prior to executing the tech. <br>

## The Risky Part

Using Valerie's Healing Touch, we can completely negate the need to drain any nutrients and can as such focus on the two cores once they split. However, Val's HT doesn't last long enough to do this for Ops, meaning we need to use it for the most intense part. <br>
To execute this method, you *must* activate Val's HT as the core splits into two, before you proceed to laser the cores. <br>
As mentioned, this is incredibly risky due to the tumours metnioned above. It is still very possible to pop Val's HT and have the patient die. And due to the Vital Lock mechanic, it is *impossible* to prevent this as you cannot boost the vitals. <br>

The best work-around for this is to ensure that no tumours are present when performing the hit of damage before the split takes place. <br>

To cause Ops to split, you must do four hits of damage. <br>
As such, you should ensure you are safe with vitals and or tumours, and then activate Val's HT the moment you get the OK for the hit taking place.<br>
If performed correctly it should look something like this: <br>
