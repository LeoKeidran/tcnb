# Stigma - Soma [Body]

[Back to Main Page](../index.md)

***This advice applies to all Operations that involve Soma.*** <br>

Soma considered the most straight forward strain of Stigma, with very few tricks thrown in to make it overly difficult.

## Order of Operations

Your main goal should be to focus on draining the tissue away to expose the core as soon as possible. <br>
The earlier you get the core exposed, the earlier you can finish the op. <br>

When Soma drops red tumours, you have approximately 6-7 seconds until it bursts. A super easy way to remember how long you have is to count four drain OKs. After the fourth, you should laser the tumour before it worsens. <br>

Once the core is exposed, you should laser it to deal damage as fast as possible. <br>
There is enough downtime after you have lasered the core to then drain the three masses. <br>

## Multiple Clouds

Depending on which op you are on, you will have to deal with two clouds, with the core being in one of them. This happens after hits the core in [3-4](../chp/chp3#3-4), two hits in [6-3](../chp/chp6.md#6-3-v), and after one hit in [7-2](../chp/chp7.md#7-2) for both patients. <br>

The cloud that contains the core will flash briefly when it spawns. It will also drop tumours. The fake *cannot* do this. <br>

Additionally they will spawn consistently in the same location for each operation. This makes it predictable if you can remember where it will spawn in. <br>
You should focus the cloud that ***does not*** flash. This is because if this is not dealt with in time, it will result in extra masses that must be drained, which can be annoying. <br>
The fake cloud will always have one less drain than the main core, so as long as you do not drain the main core, and drain them the same amount (for example if they overlap) you will be safe. <br>

There is an incredibly risky strat which is not 100% consistent, but on [3-4](../chp/chp3#3-4) it is possible to skip draining the fake cloud first, and focus on the main cloud. This is to be done on the final hit due on the core, as once it does, it immediately kills the fake core as well. <br>
Getting the timing for all of this can be incredibly tricky, especially with tumours. <br>
Utilising Markus' Healing Touch makes this possible, by focusing on the main core, and activating the Healing Touch at just the right time, you can kill off the main core before the fake cloud bursts, nullifying the need to drain it. <br>

## Paired with other Stigma

By itself, Soma isn't too much of a problem. But the moment you pair it with another Stigma strain, it can be a little more tricky. <br>
Thankfully this only happens twice, in the same operation: [7-2](../chp/chp7.md#7-2) <br>

The first occurrence, it is paired with [Cheir](cheir.md) and should be treated after Fused Cheir has been dealt with. <br>
You must pay close attention to any tumours dropped by Soma, and your laser's durability. <br>
While waiting for Cheir to fuse, you can drain Soma down to the last point, this requires four drains to achieve. <br>

The second occurrence is Soma paired with [Onyx](onyx.md) and once again should be treated after Onyx has been killed. <br>
Much like the previous patient, it is important to keep an *ear* out for any dropped tumours. This is because you are often going to need to look around for Onyx across the entire organ. Soma however will stay in the bounds of the screen where you started. <br>

Like with Cheir, you can drain Soma four times without exposing the core, which is ideal so that once you are done with Onyx you can immediately start treating Soma. <br>
