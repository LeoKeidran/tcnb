# Stigma - Cheir [Concealed Blades]

[Back to Main Page](../index.md)

***This advice applies to all Operations that involve Cheir.*** <br>

Occuring three times in the overall run, Cheir can feel like one of those operations that you either excel at, or lose chunks of time, for what feels like no reason. <br>
There is a marginal aspect or randomness that Cheir exhibits, notably with its movement as it may swerve around your cursor, or you may struggle to properly stun lock it into place. <br>
Cheir heavily relies on your laser management and accuracy to be able to effectively deal with it. <br>

## Attacks

Cheir comes in three variations (excluding the Mature/Fused variant), each with different attacks. There is no way to differentiate them physically, only by their attacks, or if you know the wave you are on for that particular patient. <br>
Keeping Cheir off the organ, or in a stun lock will prevent them from attacking. This is notably important in 6-6 when the vitals are rather low. <br>
