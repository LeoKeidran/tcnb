# Stigma - Cheir [The Hand]

[Back to Main Page](../index.md)

***This advice applies to all Operations that involve Cheir.*** <br>

Occuring three times in the overall run, Cheir can feel like one of those operations that you either excel at, or lose chunks of time, for what feels like no reason. <br>
There is a marginal aspect or randomness that Cheir exhibits, notably with its movement as it may swerve around your cursor, or you may struggle to properly stun lock it into place. <br>
Cheir heavily relies on your laser management and accuracy to be able to effectively deal with it. <br>

## Attacks

Cheir comes in three variations (excluding the Mature/Fused variant), each with different attacks. There is no way to differentiate them physically, only by their attacks, or if you know the wave you are on for that particular patient. <br>
Keeping Cheir off the organ, or in a stun lock will prevent them from attacking. This is notably important in [6-6](/chp/chp6.md#6-6] when the vitals are rather low. <br>

As Cheir goes to make a tumour, it will spin in place. Once this has started you cannot interrupt the animation. You will then hear a scream, as an audible reminder to you. Inheriently this isn't too bad, but too many tumours can quickly become a problem with the DPS. <br>
If you are getting tumours, this is likely due to the fact that Cheir isn't being stun-locked for long enough when it is roaming around. <br>

There is also an additional type of Cheir, which can make large lacerations. This only occurs in [7-2](/chp/chp7.md#7-2). Similar to the tumour spawning variant, this type will dive into the organ, and upon resurfacing they will create a large laceration. If this occurs, do not ignore it. <br>
The vital damage from this large laceration will hit all at once when it spawns, and then it will also tick the vitals down rather quickly due to the high DPS. <br>

## Laser Management

Much like the rest of the game, you'll get better at managing your laser. However there are a few pieces of advice I can give. <br>

Given that Cheir has i-frames, you will need to tap the laser instead, to ensure that you do not burn it out instantly. <br>
You can vary how fast you tap, or how long you hold the laser to achieve this result. <br>
What I recommend is not to have a set rate of how fast you laser, but instead to find a pace that works for you. If the laser durability is in the yellow, it means you need to give it more time to regenerate between taps, or to hold for less time as a whole. <br>

For Cheir specifically, you need to be mindful that running out of the laser is almost catastrophic, especially in operations where Cheir is alongside another Stigma strain. <br>

Since Cheir's movement is a little sporadic and can result in you missing, it is even more important to be mindful of your laser's durability. The best way to ensure you are landing hits is to laser where Cheir is moving to, so that they 'bump' into them. <br>

## Health

Singlular Cheir require three "OK" hits for it to be defeated. <br>
The fused or mature Cheir requires an additional hit to kill off. <br>

## Healing Touch

In the later operations that involve multiple strains of Stigma, we utilise HT to give us more time to properly clear Cheir without fear of any additional mess. <br>
With the Healing Touch active, the i-frames last longer, meaning it is more effective to 'flick' the cursor back and forth between singular Cheir. <br>

This allows us to be able to hit Cheir more often, without wasting time due to the aforementioned i-frames. <br>
That being said, HT should not be used when Cheir is by itself, and only should be used to extend the cycles when another Stigma is present. Notably Onyx and Soma, as they have timers which should be focused on over Cheir. <br>
